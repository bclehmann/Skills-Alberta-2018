What does this Fund Invest In?
The Fund invests primarily in investment grade government and government related fixed income securities denominated in local and foreign currencies around the world.

Investor Suitability
The Fund is suitable for investors seeking income and global currency, country and yield diversification at a medium risk. 

Investment Strategy
The Fund is broadly diversified across many currencies, countries and yield curves. The research process is focused on identifying and managing risk. Similar to a Central Bank, an emphasis is placed on reserve currencies and countries because they tend to hold their store of value in periods of uncertainty. Within the desired currency and country, securities are selected and actively traded with a focus on positive real returns. The Fund’s currency positions are unhedged which can increase the resilience of a balanced portfolio through additional diversification.
