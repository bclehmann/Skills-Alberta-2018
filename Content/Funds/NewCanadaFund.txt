New Canada Fund (CLOSED)

The Rundle New Canada Fund is capped to new and existing mutual fund investors. This has been done given the limited liquidity of the securities in the small cap segment of the Canadian equity market and given our desire to ensure that we continue to offer the best possible small cap product to our existing clients.

What does this Fund Invest In?
The Fund invests primarily in securities of smaller Canadian companies. Treasury bills or short-term investments, not exceeding three years to maturity, may still be used from time to time.

Investor Suitability

Investment Strategy
In order to achieve its investment strategy objectives, the Manager systematically creates a broadly diversified portfolio of wealth-creating companies with excellent management teams bought at discounts to their intrinsic values. The Manager employs a highly disciplined, research-driven, bottom-up process and a long-term holding period to allow for investor recognition or corporate growth, and to minimize transaction costs.
