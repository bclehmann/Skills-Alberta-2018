The Manager will allocate capital to the best global opportunities, which may include both large and small capitalization companies. Treasury bills or short-term investments, not exceeding three years to maturity, may also be used from time to time.

Investment Strategy
In order to achieve its investment strategy objectives, the Manager systematically creates a broadly diversified portfolio of wealth-creating companies with excellent management teams bought at discounts to their intrinsic values. The Manager employs a highly disciplined, research-driven, bottom-up process and long-term holding period to allow for investor recognition or corporate growth, and to minimize transaction costs.
